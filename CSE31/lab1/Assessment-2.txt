Q1.  What does the –c flag do in gcc?
gcc -c compiles source files without linking

Q2.  What does the –o flag do in gcc?
Write the build output to an output file.

Q3.  How do you load output0 into gdb? (give the command)
gdb output0

Q4.  How do you set breakpoint at main? (give the command)
gdb break main

Q5.  Command to run output0 inside gdb
gdb run

Q6.  Command to single-step through the program
gdb step

Q7.  First output gives the value of the most significant bit (MSB) of an unsigned int.  What is the size (# of bits) of an unsigned int?
32

Q8.  Second output gives the value of a long long int.  What is the size of a long long?
64

Q9.  Third output shows the most negative signed int.  Is the size of a signed int the same as an unsigned int?
Yes they are both 32 bit data types however the range of values they represent are different

Q10.  Fourth line shows the value of the most negative valueʼs negation, ie –most_negative_number.  What is the output and the reason for the value to be this way?  (Hint: remember the property of 2ʼs complement representation)
1000000->01111111+1=10000000=same
most negative value doesnt have positive counterpart
