1 - hello defined to hold a maximum of 6 elements,
    which gets overwritten ultimately generating the error.

2 - One way to fix the bug is to initialize 'hello' with enough space to hold the elements in 'hello' and 'world'
 'hello[20]'

3 - compile the program with the 'g' flag and then run 'gdb' followed by the executable
 C doesn't check bounds so memory management is more flexible and easier to compile

4 - pro-memory management flexibility
    con-hard to find errors and unnecessary difficulty
